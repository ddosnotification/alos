**Terms of Service**

Last updated: October 22th, 2024
Account

By registering an account on our platform, you agree to keep your login credentials secure and accept full responsibility for all activities conducted through your account. We may review new accounts before granting access to our services but are not obligated to do so. You must be 18 years or older to use our services. If you are aged 13 to 17, you may only use our services with the consent of a parent or guardian. Misrepresentation of age or attempts to bypass our security measures are strictly prohibited. We are not liable for any false age representations, and we assume all account holders either meet the age requirements or have received necessary permissions.


We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone at any time. Use of our services must comply with all applicable Australian laws, including the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 and local state regulations. Illegal activities, such as the unauthorized use of copyrighted material, defamatory content, or violations of export control regulations, are prohibited. We may collaborate with law enforcement or third parties to investigate suspected illegal activities. We reserve the right to monitor and remove any content deemed inappropriate.


If your account is used for illegal or prohibited activities, we may suspend or terminate your account and report any necessary details to law enforcement.
Billing

You are responsible for paying all fees associated with your account, in accordance with our current billing terms. Failure to make payment within 24 hours of the due date will result in suspension of services. If payment is not made within three days, your services will be terminated. If you have set up auto-renewal, you will be charged automatically according to the terms you selected. You are responsible for all fees from the time your account is created until you formally terminate your services. Outstanding debts, including any court or collection fees, remain your responsibility even after account termination.


We may offer special promotional rates or deals, but you cannot switch services solely to receive a promotional discount. Certain promotions may not be combined. We reserve the right to modify product pricing and limit the number of purchases per customer or household. If we need to change or cancel an order, we will make efforts to notify you via email, phone, or other available communication channels.


In cases where a purchase appears fraudulent, we may request additional verification, such as a valid photo ID or a recent bank statement. If you dispute a charge, your services will be suspended immediately, and no refund will be issued unless the matter is resolved through our official support channels.
Refunds

Refunds may be requested within six (6) hours of the purchase time, provided there is a legitimate reason. ALOS Shield reserves the right to deny any refund request deemed inappropriate. Refund requests made through any medium other than our official support system will not be considered.
Acceptable Use

All clients must comply with ALOS Shieldâ€™s acceptable use policies. Violations of these policies may result in the suspension or termination of services. Prohibited activities include, but are not limited to:

- Denial of Service (DoS) attacks
- Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks
- Spamming
- Phishing
- Illegal activities

If you receive an abuse report, you are required to respond within 24 hours with an explanation and proposed resolution. Failure to respond promptly may result in the suspension of services until the issue is resolved. Continued violations may lead to the termination of services and a ban from our network. Abuse reports must be submitted via our official client area.
Fair Use

Our 'unlimited data' offerings are governed by a fair use policy, which ensures equal access for all users and protects the stability of our network. While we do not enforce strict data caps, we reserve the right to apply reasonable usage guidelines. Excessive or abusive usage that puts strain on our network resources may result in additional charges or temporary suspension of service. This policy is in place to maintain a high-quality experience for all users and prevent misuse that could degrade network performance.
